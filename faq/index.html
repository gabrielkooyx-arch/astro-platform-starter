What exactly is &quot;Investment Mis-Selling&quot;?</h2> <div class="markdown"><p>Mis-selling occurs when a financial product is sold to you in a way that is misleading, ignores your investment objective/risk tolerance, or fails to disclose key information, etc. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being recommended a high-risk product that does not suit your profile or personal circumstances.</li>
<li>Being pressured into an investment you didn&#39;t fully understand.</li>
</ul>
</div> </div><div class="faq-item"> <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-primary">2. Does a loss in the market automatically mean I was mis-sold?</h2> <div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. All investments carry some level of market risk. However, if the process by which that investment was sold to you violated regulatory standards, such as failing to perform a suitability test, you may have a valid claim for recovery regardless of how the market performed.</p>
</div> </div><div class="faq-item"> <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-primary">3. How do I know if I have a case?</h2> <div class="markdown"><p>The easiest way is to let us take a look. We review your original investment goals, the brochures and documents provided at the time of sale, and the subsequent performance. If there is a gap between what you were promised and what the regulations require, we will find it.</p>
</div> </div><div class="faq-item"> <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-primary">4. How long does the recovery process usually take?</h2> <div class="markdown"><p>Every case is unique. Some financial institutions resolve complaints within a month of receiving our formal letter, while complex cases can take longer. Our goal is always to achieve the fastest resolution possible without compromising the quality of your claim.</p>
</div> </div><div class="faq-item"> <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-primary">5. What documents should I have ready?</h2> <div class="markdown"><p>To provide the most accurate assessment, it helps to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>The account opening agreement.</li>
<li>The investor profile assessment form.</li>
<li>The original investment agreement or contract.</li>
<li>Order taking correspondences between you and the relationship manager or investment counsellor.</li>
<li>Records of correspondence (emails/letters) with the institution.</li>
<li>Portfolio statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re missing something; we can help you request copies.</p>
</div> </div><div class="faq-item"> <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-primary">6.

</div> </div><div class="faq-item"> <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-primary">7. What if the financial institution rejects my claim?</h2> <div class="markdown"><p>Rejection is a common tactic used by institutions to see if a complainant will give up. If your claim has merit, we don&#39;t stop there. We assist you in escalating the matter to the relevant complaint resolution bodies or regulator to ensure an independent review of your case.</p>
