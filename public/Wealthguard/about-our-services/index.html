<p>We will help you assess the situation under which your investment losses were realized, and if the financial institution has failed to comply with regulatory requirements or expectations, which could be characterized as mis-selling. Accordingly, we will recommend the best strategy to ensure that your complaint regarding investment losses is heard and taken seriously by the financial institution, increasing the chance of getting compensation.</p>
</div> <div class="markdown mb-8"><p>To achieve this objective:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Case Assessment</strong> â€“ We don&#39;t guess; we investigate. We begin by conducting a deep-dive interview and a thorough review of all relevant documents/information (please see FAQs) to assess the merits of your complaint and areas that we should focus on.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Strategic Correspondences and Advocacy</strong> â€“ The biggest hurdle in investment recovery is the &quot;paperwork wall.&quot; We will assist you in drafting a professional, evidence-backed complaint letter and any subsequent correspondence with the financial institution until a resolution is reached.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Escalation to Regulatory Bodies</strong> â€“ If the financial institution refuses to acknowledge a valid claim, we don&#39;t stop there. We assist in raising the complaint in writing to the appropriate complaint resolution bodies or regulator, where required.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div> <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-4 text-primary">Need Legal Action?</h3> <div class="markdown"><p>If you remain dissatisfied with the conclusion/resolution and would like to take legal action against the financial institution, we could refer you to an experienced and trusted legal firm if you don&#39;t have one. In such a situation, to help the legal firm to understand your complaint, we will share all relevant documents/information, including our review work and conclusion. This will help you reduce the legal fee and allow prompt action to be taken by the legal firm on your behalf.</p>
